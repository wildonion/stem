// ------------------------------- RANDOMNESS IMITATES DETERMINISM -------------------------------
// continuously means sequences of chained steps in which randomness is imitating determinism and 
// the increasing of entropy only makes it more complicated and brings more feature to imitate a 
// deterministic environment and produce the butterfly effect; so if we can find a way 
// using AI RL algos to detect the increasing of entropy or when we'll get the butterfly effect 
// we can prove that the cosmos is continuously moving forward with a lots of features and 
// increased entropy by the time. 
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



// NOTE - first step to solve a problem is to use the divide and conqure algorithm and put each of them inside a free thread as a mutex
// NOTE - it's all about sequence learning which means we're learning constantly from the past thus in order to have a stable system we have to put inputs inside a contiguous environment so it can learn from the past and predict the future from the past or complete an unseen and lost part of the input
// NOTE - randomness is an unordered set so if we could make it bigger by adding more entropy we could generate an ordered set since complexity produce a contiguous environment which contains ordered sets
// NOTE - small world and the strength of weak ties effect is based on the butterfly effect
